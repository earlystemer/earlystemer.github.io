        <h1>Mercury</h1>
        <h2>The Swiftest Planet</h2>
        <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU.</li>
          <li>Mercury has no moons.</li>
          <li>One day on Mercury (the time it takes for Mercury to rotate or spin once with respect to the stars) takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Venus</h1>
        <h2>Planetary Hot Spot</h2>
        <p>Second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor, Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, but it is now a very different world. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most planets do. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system—with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Venus has no moons and no rings.</li>
          <li>One day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days because Venus spins backwards, with its sun rising in the west and setting in the east.</li>
          <li>The planet’s surface temperature is about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius)—hot enough to melt lead.</li>

        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <h2>Our Home Planet</h2>
        <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel.</li>
          <li>A day on Earth is 24 hours. Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.</li>
          <li>Earth has one moon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Mars</h1>
        <h2>The Red Planet</h2>
        <p>The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.</li>
          <li>Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos.</li>
          <li>Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.</li>

        <h1>Jupiter</h1>
        <h2>Twice as massive as all the other planets combined</h2>
        <p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).</li>
          <li>Jupiter has more than 75 moons.</li>
          <li>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that’s about twice the size of Earth and has raged for over a century.</li>

        <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <h2>Jewel of Our Solar System</h2>
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saturn has the most spectacular ring system, with seven rings and several gaps and divisions between them.</li>
          <li>Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.</li>
          <li>Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn’s diameter. That doesn’t include Saturn’s rings.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="cyan-border sub-section">
        <h1>Uranus</h1>
        <h2>The Sideways Planet</h2>
        <p>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Uranus would be the size of a basketball.</li>
          <li>Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).</li>
          <li>Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. But Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its side.</li>

        <h1>Neptune</h1>
        <h2>The Windiest Planet</h2>
        <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once (a Neptunian day), and about 165 Earth years to orbit the sun (a Neptunian year).</li>
          <li>Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>
          <li>Neptune has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are clumps of dust and debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="brown-border sub-section">
        <h1>Pluto</h1>
        <h2>The Windiest Planet</h2>
        <p>Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and maybe glaciers. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A year on Pluto is 248 Earth years. A day on Pluto lasts 153 hours, or about 6 Earth days.</li>
          <li>Pluto has 5 moons. The largest, Charon, is so big that Pluto and Charon orbit each other like a double planet.</li>
          <li>Pluto’s surface is far too cold, -378 to -396 degrees F (-228 to -238 C), to sustain life as we know it.</li>
        </ul>
